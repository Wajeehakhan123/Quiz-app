Quiz App Using JavaScript

Project Description

This project is an interactive Quiz Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to test their knowledge through multiple-choice questions within a time-limited environment. It is designed with a clean user interface, smooth animations, and responsive layout to ensure a good user experience across different devices.

The project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for dynamic content rendering, event handling, timer management, and score calculation.

Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

To create an interactive quiz system using JavaScript
